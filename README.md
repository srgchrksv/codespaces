# codespaces

Its just an empty repo to use codespaces when I dont need to create separate repo for project.

## If you dont know what codespaces is:
***"Spin up fully configured dev environments in the cloud that start in seconds with up to 60 hours a month free." Github Codespaces [https://github.com/features/codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)***

To begin using codespaces you got to have a repository with minimum one file, readme for example. Or create codespaces for any of your current project repos.

Happy coding!
